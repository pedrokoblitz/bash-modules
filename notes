# get last line
tail -n 1 "$FILE"


# remove first line
tail -n +2 "$FILE"

# remove first line if is empty
The simplest thing in sed is:

sed '1{/^$/d}'
Note that this does not delete a line that contains all blanks, but only a line that contains nothing but a single newline. To get rid of blanks:

# other sed

sed '1{/^ *$/d}'
and to eliminate all whitespace:

sed '1{/^[[:space:]]*$/d}'

To run a daemon or any command as root before login, add it to /etc/rc.local or add a cron job with @reboot as its time field. You can also write a proper init script based on /etc/init.d/skeleton.
To run a command after login, add it to ~/.bash_profile (provided you re using bash). Contrary to ~/.bashrc, this file will be executed by login shells only.
To run a command after login of any new user, add an appropriate .bash_profile to /etc/skel and new users will get this file automatically on account creation.
